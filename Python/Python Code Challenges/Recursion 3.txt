Recursion 3

Building Our Own Call Stack, Part II

We used an iterative function to implement how a call stack accumulates execution contexts during recursive function calls.

We’ll now address the conclusion of this function, where the separate values stored in the call stack are accumulated into a single return value.

recursion.py :

def sum_to_one(n):
  result = 1
  call_stack = []
  
  while n != 1:
    execution_context = {"n_value": n}
    call_stack.append(execution_context)
    n -= 1
    print(call_stack)
  print("BASE CASE REACHED")
  return result, call_stack

sum_to_one(4)


1.
This is the point in a recursive function when we would begin returning values as the function calls are “popped” off the call stack.

We’ll use another while loop to simulate this process. Write the while loop below the “Base Case Reached” print statement.

This loop will run as long as there are execution contexts stored in call_stack.

Inside this second loop:

declare the variable return_value
assign the last element in call_stack to return_value.
Remove that value from call_stack otherwise you’ll have an infinite loop!
Print call_stack to see how the execution contexts are removed from call_stack.


def sum_to_one(n):
  result = 1
  call_stack = []
  
  while n != 1:
    execution_context = {"n_value": n}
    call_stack.append(execution_context)
    n -= 1
    print(call_stack)
  print("BASE CASE REACHED")
  while len(call_stack) != 0:
    return_value = call_stack.pop()
    
  return result, call_stack

sum_to_one(4)


-------------

2.
Print that you’re adding return_value["n_value"] to result and their respective values.

Finish the loop by retrieving "n_value" from return_value and add it to result.

def sum_to_one(n):
  result = 1
  call_stack = []
  
  while n != 1:
    execution_context = {"n_value": n}
    call_stack.append(execution_context)
    n -= 1
    print(call_stack)
  print("BASE CASE REACHED")
  while len(call_stack) != 0:
    return_value = call_stack.pop()
    print("Return value of {0} adding to result of {1}".format(return_value['n_value'], result))
    result += return_value['n_value']
  return result, call_stack

sum_to_one(4)

--------------------------------

Sum to One with Recursion

Now that we’ve built a mental model for how recursion is handled by Python, let’s implement the same function and make it truly recursive.

To recap: We want a function that takes an integer as an input and returns the sum of all numbers from the input down to 1.

sum_to_one(4)
# 4 + 3 + 2 + 1
# 10


Here’s how this function would look if we were to write it iteratively:

def sum_to_one(n):
  result = 0
  for num in range(n, 0, -1):
    result += num
  return result

sum_to_one(4)
# num is set to 4, 3, 2, and 1
# 10


We can think of each recursive call as an iteration of the loop above. In other words, we want a recursive function that will produce the following function calls:

recursive_sum_to_one(4)
recursive_sum_to_one(3)
recursive_sum_to_one(2)
recursive_sum_to_one(1)

Every recursive function needs a base case when the function does not recurse, and a recursive step, when the recursing function moves towards the base case.

Base case:

The integer given as input is 1.

Recursive step:

The recursive function call is passed an argument 1 less than the last function call.

1.
Define the sum_to_one() function.

It takes n as the sole parameter.

We’ll start by setting up our base case.

This function should NOT recurse if the given input, n is 1.

In the base case, we return n.


def sum_to_one(n):
  if n == 1:
    return n


2.
Now, we’ll consider the recursive step.

We want our return value to be the current input added to the return value of sum_to_one().

We also need to invoke sum_to_one() with an argument that will get us closer to the base case.

# return {recursive call} + {current input}


def sum_to_one(n):
  if n == 1:
    return n
  return n + sum_to_one(n - 1)

3.
Each recursive call is responsible for adding one of those integers to the ultimate total.

To help us visualize the different function calls, add a print statement before the recursive call that tells us the current value of n.

Use the following string for the print statement: print("Recursing with input: {0}".format(n))

Let’s test out our function. Call sum_to_one() with 7 as input and print out the result

def sum_to_one(n):
  if n == 1:
    return n
  print("Recursing with input: {0}".format(n))
  return n + sum_to_one(n - 1)
  
# uncomment when you're ready to test
print(sum_to_one(7))


Output:

Recursing with input: 7
Recursing with input: 6
Recursing with input: 5
Recursing with input: 4
Recursing with input: 3
Recursing with input: 2
28
