2. Over 9000
We are constructing a device that is able to measure the power level of our coding abilities and according to the device, it will be impossible for our power levels to be over 9000. Because of this, as we iterate through a list of power values we will count up each of the numbers until our sum reaches a value greater than 9000. Once this happens, we should stop adding the numbers and return the value where we stopped. In order to do this, we will need the following steps:

Define the function to accept a list of numbers
Create a variable to keep track of our sum
Iterate through every element in our list of numbers
Within the loop, add the current number we are looking at to our sum
Still within the loop, check if the sum is greater than 9000. If it is, end the loop
Return the value of the sum when we ended our loop

Coding question
Create a function named over_nine_thousand() that takes a list of numbers named lst as a parameter.

The function should sum the elements of the list until the sum is greater than 9000. When this happens, the function should return the sum. If the sum of all of the elements is never greater than 9000, the function should return total sum of all the elements. If the list is empty, the function should return 0.

For example, if lst was [8000, 900, 120, 5000], then the function should return 9020.

Hint
Create a variable named sum that begins at 0. Loop through all of the elements of lst and use a break when the sum is greater than 9000. Return sum after the loop.

def over_nine_thousand(lst):
  sum = 0
  for number in lst:
    sum += number
    if (sum>9000):
      break
  return sum

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(over_nine_thousand([8000, 900, 120, 5000]))

Output: 9020

Here is this solution:

def over_nine_thousand(lst):
  sum = 0
  for number in lst:
    sum += number
    if (sum > 9000):
      break
  return sum

Our solution follows a similar pattern to some of the other code challenges, except that we have a condition where we end early. In the case where we reach a sum greater than 9000, we can use the break keyword to exit our loop. This will continue to execute the code outside of our loop, which in this case, returns the sum that we found.

------------------------
3. Max Num
Here is a more traditional coding problem for you. This function will be used to find the maximum number in a list of numbers. This can be accomplished using the max() function in python, but as a challenge, we are going to manually implement this function. Here is what we need to do:

Define the function to accept a list of numbers called nums
Set our default maximum value to be the first element in the list
Loop through every number in the list of numbers
Within the loop, if we find a number greater than our starting maximum, then replace the maximum with what we found.
Return the maximum number

Coding question
Create a function named max_num() that takes a list of numbers named nums as a parameter.

The function should return the largest number in nums

Hint
Create a variable called maximum to track the max number, and have it start as the first element in the list. Loop through all of the numbers in the list, and if a number is ever greater than the current max number, the max number should be re-set to that number.

def max_num(nums):
  maximum = nums[0]
  for number in nums:
    if number > maximum:
      maximum = number
  return maximum


#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(max_num([50, -10, 0, 75, 20]))

Output: 75

Here is one way to solve this:

def max_num(nums):
  maximum = nums[0]
  for number in nums:
    if number > maximum:
      maximum = number
  return maximum

There are a few different ways to accomplish this task, but the way we did it was to check every element in the list and see if there is one bigger than what we currently think is the biggest. If there is a bigger one, then replace it. We keep replacing the number until the largest number has been found.

---------------------------------

4. Same Values
In this challenge, we need to find the indices in two equally sized lists where the numbers match. We will be iterating through both of them at the same time and comparing the values, if the numbers are equal, then we record the index. These are the steps we need to accomplish this:

Define our function to accept two lists of numbers
Create a new list to store our matching indices
Loop through each index to the end of either of our lists
Within the loop, check if our first list at the current index is equal to the second list at the current index. If so, append the index where they matched
Return our list of indices

Write a function named same_values() that takes two lists of numbers of equal size as parameters.

The function should return a list of the indices where the values were equal in lst1 and lst2.

For example, the following code should return [0, 2, 3]

same_values([5, 1, -10, 3, 3], [5, 10, -10, 3, 5])

Hint
Loop through all of the indices of each list using for index in range(len(lst1)) and compare lst1[index] to lst2[index]. Append index to a new list if those two items are equal.

def same_values(lst1, lst2):
  new_lst = []
  for index in range(len(lst1)):
    if lst1[index] == lst2[index]:
      new_lst.append(index)
  return new_lst


#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(same_values([5, 1, -10, 3, 3], [5, 10, -10, 3, 5]))

Output: [0, 2, 3]

Here’s how we did it:

def same_values(lst1, lst2):
  new_lst = []
  for index in range(len(lst1)):
    if lst1[index] == lst2[index]:
      new_lst.append(index)
  return new_lst

In this solution, we used a loop that iterates using the range of the len of our list. This generates the indices we need to iterate through. Note that we assume the lists are of equal size. We then access the element at the current index from each list using lst1[index] and lst2[index]. If they are equal we add the index to the new list. Finally, we return the results.

5. Reversed List
For the final challenge, we are going to test two lists to see if the second list is the reverse of the first list. There are a few different ways to approach this, but we are going to try a method that iterates through each of the values in one direction for the first list and compares them against the values starting from the other direction in the second list. Here is what you need to do:

Define a function that has two input parameters for our lists
Loop through every index in one of the lists from beginning to end
Within the loop, compare the element in the first list at the current index against the element at the second list’s last index minus the current index. If there was a mismatch, then the lists aren’t reversed and we can return False
If the loop ended successfully, then we know the lists are reversed and we can return True.
Coding question
Create a function named reversed_list() that takes two lists of the same size as parameters named lst1 and lst2.

The function should return True if lst1 is the same as lst2 reversed. The function should return False otherwise.

For example, reversed_list([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]) should return True.

Hint
Let's say the lists are of size 5. You want to compare lst1[0] with lst2[4], lst1[1] with lst2[3] and so on.
Loop through the numbers created by range(len(lst1)) using a variable named index

Compare lst1[index] to lst2[len(lst2) - 1 - index]. If those two items are not equal, return False. If you loop through the entire list and you never return False, that means that every item was equal, and you should return True.

def reversed_list(lst1, lst2):
  for index in range(len(lst1)):
    if lst1[index] != lst2[len(lst2) - 1 - index]:
      return False
  return True

#Uncomment the lines below when your function is done
print(reversed_list([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]))
print(reversed_list([1, 5, 3], [3, 2, 1]))

Output:
True
False

Here is one way to do it:

def reversed_list(lst1, lst2):
  for index in range(len(lst1)):
    if lst1[index] != lst2[len(lst2) - 1 - index]:
      return False
  return True

In this code, we iterate through each of the indices for the entire length of either of the lists (since we assume the lengths are equal) and we perform a comparison on each of the elements. We get the element at the current index from our first list with lst1[index] and we test it against the last index of the second list minus the current index len(lst2) - 1 – index.

That math is a little complicated — it helps to look at a concrete example. If we are given a list of 5 elements, the valid indices are 0 to 4. Because of this, the last index in the second list is len(lst2) - 1, or 5 - 1 = 4. Now in order to get the inverse of the position we are at in the first list, we subtract the index we are at from the end of the second list. So on the first pass, we’ll compare the element at position 0 to the element at position 5 - 1 - 0 = 4. On the next pass, we’ll compare the element at position 1 to the element at position 5 - 1 - 1 = 3, and so on.

If any of the two elements are not equal then we know that the second list is not the reverse of the first list and we return False. If we made it to the end without a mismatch then we can return True since the second list is the reverse of the first. You could also try simplifying this code by using the python function reversed() or other methods that you will learn later on such as ‘slicing’.
