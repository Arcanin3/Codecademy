Python Code Challenges: Strings (Advanced)

Function Syntax

def some_function(some_input1, some_input2):
  # … do something with the inputs …
  return output

a function that finds the difference in length between two Strings would look like this:

def lengthDiff(str1, str2):
  return len(str1) - len(str2)

And this would produce output like:

>>> lengthDiff("Python", "rocks")
1
>>> lengthDiff("Marco", "Polo")
1
>>> lengthDiff("Kevin", "Durant")
-1

1. Check Name
You are creating an app that allows users to interact and share their coding project ideas online. The first step is to provide your name in the application and a greeting for other people to see which contains your name. Let’s create a function that is able to check if a user’s name is located within their greeting. We need a function that accepts two parameters, a string for our sentence and a string for a name. The function should return True if the name exists within the string (ignoring any differences in capitalization). Here is what we need to do:

Define the function to accept two parameters, one string for the sentence and one string for the name
Convert all of the strings to the same case so we don’t have to worry about differences in capitalization
Check if the name is within the sentence. If so, then return True. Otherwise, return False

Write a function called check_for_name that takes two strings as parameters named sentence and name. The function should return True if name appears in sentence in all lowercase letters, all uppercase letters, or with any mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. The function should return False otherwise.

For example, the following three calls should all return True:

check_for_name("My name is Jamie", "Jamie")
check_for_name("My name is jamie", "Jamie")
check_for_name("My name is JAMIE", "Jamie")

name.lower() in sentence.lower() will help you find out if the name is in the sentence.

def check_for_name(sentence, name):
  return name.lower() in sentence.lower()

print(check_for_name("My name is Jamie", "Jamie"))

print(check_for_name("My name is jamie", "Jamie"))

print(check_for_name("My name is Samantha", "Jamie"))

>>>True
>>>True
>>>False

As you can see, this function can be created using one line. The in keyword will return True if the first provided string is within the second. So in this case, we’re checking if name is in sentence. In order to ignore differences in capitalization, we can use the .lower() function which converts all characters to lowercase characters.

2. Every Other Letter
For this next challenge, we are going to create a function that extracts every other letter from a string and returns the resulting string. There are a few different ways you can solve this problem. Here are the steps needed for one of the ways:

Define the function to accept one parameter for the string
Create a new empty string to hold every other letter from the input string
Loop through the input string while incrementing by two every time
Inside the loop, append the character at the current location to the new string we initialized earlier
Return the new string

Create a function named every_other_letter that takes a string named word as a parameter. The function should return a string containing every other letter in word.

The following code will print all letters of a string by index:
my_string = "Hello World"
for i in range(len(my_string)):
  print my_string[i]

In this code, i starts at 0 and increase until it is once less than the length of my_string. How could you make i increase by more than one each time?

Additionally, instead of printing each individual letter, you should add each letter to a new string using +.

def every_other_letter(word):
  every_other = ""
  for i in range(0, len(word), 2):
    every_other += word[i]
  return every_other

print(every_other_letter("Hello world!"))

>>>Hlowrd

Here is one way to do it:

def every_other_letter(word):
  every_other = ""
  for i in range(0, len(word), 2):
    every_other += word[i]
  return every_other

In order to alternate which character is added to the every_other string, we use a range of indices which starts at index 0 (the beginning of our word) and ends at the end of our word. The third parameter in the range function determines what value to increment by. In this case, we want to increment by 2 in order to get every other letter.

Another way to loop through all indices of our original string, but only add the letters that correspond to an even index. As a challenge, try solving this problem that way!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Reverse
This one is similar to the last challenge. Instead of selecting every other letter, we want to reverse the entire string. This can be performed in a similar manner, but we will need to modify the range we are using. Here is what we need to do:

Define the function to accept one parameter for the string
Create a new empty string to hold the reversed string
Loop through the input string by starting at the end, and working towards the beginning
Inside the loop, append the character at the current location to the new string we initialized earlier
Return the result

Write a function named reverse_string that has a string named word as a parameter. The function should return word in reverse.

Just like the last challenge, you want to access each letter of word by it's index.
my_string = "Hello World"
for i in range(len(my_string)):
  print my_string[i]

However, you don’t want i to start at 0. Instead you want it to start at the last index of your string (len(my_string)-1) and end at 0.

Edit the call to the range function to do this. Remember, the range function can take three parameters: the starting number (inclusive), the ending number (exclusive), and the step. To count down, make the step -1.

def reverse_string(word):
  reverse = ""
  for i in range(len(word)-1, -1, -1):
    reverse += word[i]
  return reverse

print(reverse_string("Hello world!"))

>>>!dlrow olleH

This is similar to the last solution, but our range has been modified in order to start at the last index of the string (length of the string minus one) up to the first index. Since the parameter for the ending index is exclusive we need to provide the index of one more iteration than what we want to stop at. We want to stop at 0, and since we are incrementing by -1, we will set the ending index to -1. Finally, make sure to add the third parameter of -1. This makes us increment by -1 at each step.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Make Spoonerism
A Spoonerism is an error in speech when the first syllables of two words are switched. For example, a Spoonerism is made when someone says “Belly Jeans” instead of “Jelly Beans”. We are going to make a function that is similar, but instead of using the first syllable, we are going to switch the first character of two words. Here is what we need to do:

Define the function to accept two parameters for our two words
Get the first character of the first word and the first character of the second word
Get the remaining characters of the first word and the remaining characters of the second word.
Append the first character of the second word to the remaining character of the first word
Append a space character
Append the first character of the first word to the remaining characters of the second word.
Return the result

Write a function called make_spoonerism that takes two strings as parameters named word1 and word2. Finding the first syllable of a word is a difficult task, so for our function, we’re going to switch the first letters of each word. Return the two new words as a single string separated by a space.

word2[0] will access the first letter of word2. word1[1:] will access everything but the first letter of word1. Combining those with a + will give you your first new word.

def make_spoonerism(word1, word2):
  return word2[0]+word1[1:]+" "+word1[0]+word2[1:]

print(make_spoonerism("Hello", "world!"))

>>>wello Horld!

We can accomplish the task in one line by appending and slicing at the same time. We can get the first index of our words by using word1[0] and word2[0] which gets the letter at the first index. In order to get the remaining letters we can use word1[1:] and word2[1:]. This returns all characters in the strings starting with index 1 and on. We concatenate everything together to get the result.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Add Exclamation
Let’s say we are writing a program that displays a large message on a blimp and we need to fill in any missing space if a short phrase is provided. Our function will accept a string and if the size is less than 20, it will fill in the remaining space with exclamation marks until the size reaches 20. If the provided string already has a length greater than 20, then we will simply return the original string. Here are the steps:

Define the function to accept one parameter for our string
Loop while the length of our input string is less than 20
Inside the loop, append an exclamation mark
Once done, return the result

Create a function named add_exclamation that has one parameter named word. This function should add exclamation points to the end of word until word is 20 characters long. If word is already at least 20 characters long, just return word.

Use a while loop to add exclamation points to word. The while loop should stop when the length of word is greater than or equal to 20.

def add_exclamation(word):
  while(len(word) <20):
    word += "!"
  return word

This function shows how we can continuously append to our string based on some condition. In this case, we keep testing the length of the string to see if we should keep going. Once the length has reached 20, either by adding exclamation marks or by already being long, we return the result.
